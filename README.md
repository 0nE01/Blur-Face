### Have ever seen that in television shows some face get bluerd for some perticular resesones ? Meybe their are crimnies or thier are some solders that thier faces should be bluerd becuze their  thier identification must be secrete and thier faces should'nt be shown to public 


In this repo we'll create a blur face programm with help of yolo for bluring any faces.
We create a yolo to detecte faces and after that by help of opencv we blured faces.

In this project :
* You can learn opencv functions
* You can learn how to use ultralytics liberey
* You can use model in your own project
